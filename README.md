## Repository overview

This repository was developed by a student to centralize the materials available for the practical part of the Embedded Systems course, taught at UFES (Federal University of Espírito Santo) and offered for the Electrical and Computer Engineering students.
As of now (2nd semester of 2023), the course is in between shifting from using solely the Intel x86 architecture to focusing on some newer technologies such as the ESP32 development boards, to try and provide an easy way into a more ‘hands-on’ course.
That being said, the material will be divided into two parts, one with the older x86 projects and another with the newly proposed projects, based on the ESP32 Development Board.
This second material is subject to change, as the new course material is still in development and may be migrated to another dev board at will, as it already used the EFM32 Gecko Starter Kit, for example.

The main reason for this repository is to try and ease the practical lessons by providing code with comments and throughout explanation of the solutions developed, as well as trying to give a better understanding of the proposed problems and how they relate with theory, especially when it comes to the Intel x86 focused practical classes.

The scripts for the practical classes were developed by:
- x86 based: Prof. Dr. Evandro Ottoni Teatini Salles and Prof. Dr. Jorge Aching Samatelo.
- ESP32 based: Prof. Dr. Camilo Arturo Rodriguez Diaz.
